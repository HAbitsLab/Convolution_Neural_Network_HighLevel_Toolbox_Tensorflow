## Introduction
This tool aims to provide a easy-plug-in Convolution neural network in high-level structure. The main contributions of it are 
1) Easy to use and very flexible. If you want to try different architectures like VGG16, Alexnet or diy your own structure, you just need to change one line of code in the main call. 
2) Easy to tune parameters. All parameters that can influence the performance will be able to tune in the main fuction by just one line of code
3)It contians several models from easy to complicated. Includes: 2D CNN, 3D CNN, Bilinear CNN, M-fusion CNN, Two-stream CNN for motion recoginition.
4)Every model has two version--one for handle small dataset or low resolution image(eg:48*48) and one handle big data with high resolution image so that you can deal with the limitation of hardware of your pc
